**PROJECT REPORT**

**Title:** A/B Testing Performance Analysis


**1.	Problem Statement**
The business is testing two versions of a website (Version A and Version B) to determine which version leads to better user conversion.
Users were randomly exposed to either version, and their engagement and conversion behavior were recorded.

The problem is to identify which website version performs better based on user behavior and conversion outcomes,
and to provide a data driven recommendation that supports business decision making.

**2.	Business Objective**

The primary objectives of this project are to:

I.	Determine which website version (A or B) has a higher conversion rate

II.	Understand user engagement through page views and time spent

III.	Analyze performance across devices and locations

**3.	Dataset**

Number of records: 5,000

Column Descriptions

**Column Name	       Description**
- User ID	    -    Unique identifier for each user
- Group	      -    Website version shown to the user (A or B)
- Page Views	-    Number of pages viewed by the user
- Time Spent	-    Time spent on the website in seconds
- Conversion	-    Whether the user completed the desired action (Yes / No)
- Device	    -    Device used to access the website (Mobile or Desktop)
- Location	  -    User’s geographic location

**4.	Tools Used**

**I.	SQL**

- Data exploration

- Aggregations

**5.	Key Metrics (KPIs)**

The following KPIs were defined and analyzed:

I.	Total Users

II.	Total Conversions

III.	Conversion Rate

IV.	Average Time Spent

V.	Average Page Views

**6.	Analysis & Findings**

**6.1	A/B Group Performance**

I.	Group B recorded a significantly higher conversion rate than Group A

II.	Engagement metrics (time spent and page views) were similar for both groups

III.	Version B improves conversions without negatively affecting user experience

**6.2	Engagement Analysis**

Users who converted generally:

I.	Viewed more pages

II.	Spent more time on the website

**6.3	Device Analysis**

I.	User behavior differs between Mobile and Desktop

II.	Conversion rate varies by device

III.	Group B performs consistently better across devices

**6.4	Location Analysis**

I.	Conversion rates differ across locations

II.	Some regions show stronger performance

**7.	Dashboard Summary (Excel)**

An interactive Excel dashboard was created to present the findings.

**Dashboard Features**

I.	KPI cards for quick performance overview

II.	Charts comparing Group A vs Group B

III.	Device and location breakdowns

IV.	Slicers for interactive filtering

V.	Dashboard Insight Statement

**8.	Business Recommendation**

Based on the analysis:

I.	Deploy Version B as the website version

II.	There should be focus on high engagement users for improvement efforts 

III.	Marketing strategies should be focused on regions that showed stronger performance
